Help support OpenFL!

OpenFL has always been an open, free project to help support your needs and power your next great idea. Your help supports the ongoing development and future growth of OpenFL. Let's make OpenFL even more awesome!

---

As a group of volunteers you can help us in a few ways

- Giving developer time on the project. (Message us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tDgq8EE) for guidance)
- Giving funds by becoming one of our sponsors!

If you'd like to sustain the future of the project as a whole, we have a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/openfl) or an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/openfl/contribute) that you can donate to.

You can also support [Joshua](https://github.com/sponsors/jgranick) directly.

Thank you!
