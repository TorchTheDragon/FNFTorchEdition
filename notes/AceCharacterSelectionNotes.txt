#FreeplayState.hx

Made Variable curDifficulty into public static var
Made Variable curSelected into public static var
Added "public static var curCharacter:Int = 0;" underneath "public static var curDifficulty:Int = 1;"
Added "var diffCalcText:FlxText;", "var charText:FlxText;" and "var charIcon:FlxSprite;" underneath "var diffText:FlxText;"
Under "diffText = new FlxText..." added three lines for "diffCalcText = new FlxText..."
Added three lines of code above "add(scoreText);" for "charText = new FlxText..."
Added import "import Song.SwagSong;"
Below "PlayState.storyDifficulty = curDifficulty;" I added "PlayState.storyChar = curCharacter;"
Above "if (accepted)" added two lines to change character
Above changeSelection function added another function for changeChar

#PlayState.hx

Added "public static var storyChar:Int = 0;" above "public static var storyDifficulty:Int = 1;"
Above "boyfriend = new Boyfriend(770, 450, SONG.player1);" added an if/else if statement for storyChar
Below the entire "switch (SONG.player2)" section put an if/else if statement below it. ex: 
        if (storyChar == 1)
        {   
        	SONG.player1 = 'bf-character1';
	}
	else if (storyChar == 2)
	{
		SONG.player1 = 'bf-character2';
	}

#StoryMenuState.hx

Above "PlayState.storyWeek = curWeek;" added "PlayState.storyChar = curChar;"
Added "var curChar:Int = 0;" above "var curDifficulty:Int = 1;"
Above changeDifficuly function added a function for changeCharacter -- The "switch (curChar)" inside of it looks to just be for changing the bf in middle of screen to other characters
Above changeWeek function added new function for changeSelection
Above "var difficultySelectors:FlxGroup;" added three variables: 
    	var characterSelectors:FlxGroup;
	var leftCharArrow:FlxSprite;
	var rightCharArrow:FlxSprite;
Below "add(grpWeekCharacters);" add these two lines:
    	characterSelectors = new FlxGroup();
	add(characterSelectors);
Below the "add(characterSelectors);, made two FlxSprites for leftCharArrow and rightCharArrow
Added multiple lines in the "if (controls.RIGHT)" and "if (controls.LEFT)" section. You will have to look into it yourself, too much to add here
Added stuff to all the "if (controls.)" sections, again, you will have to check them yourselves
In the if statement "if (stopspamming == false)". Changed the confirm animation depending on who you pick
Deleted this entire line: "difficultySelectors.visible = weekUnlocked[curWeek];"
Added function changeCharacter. It will also change the idle animation in the story menu.

Testing Something:
	Added selectedCharacter as a String Variable - Below weekUnlocked variable add "public var selectedCharacter:String = 'bf';"
	In function updateText, changed "grpWeekCharacters.members[1].setCharacter(weekCharacters[curWeek][1]);" to "grpWeekCharacters.members[1].setCharacter(selectedCharacter);"
	Gonna add a way to change variable in the function changeCharacter
THIS ACTUALLY FUCKING WORKS LMAO ^

#Additional Notes

For testing purposes, if using normal bf and christmas bf, I reconmend changing christmas bf's icon to someone else just to see if it worked.
