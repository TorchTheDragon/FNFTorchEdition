So, I need to start planning for a mod I guess.

1. I will probably not include a character selection for the kind of mod I want to do
2. It will definitely have 3-4 weeks (possibly)
3. I need to create stages for all weeks as well as songs
4. May do a slightly redone tutorial
5. Need to come up with different notes per character
6. Need to learn how to add dialogue and cutscenes
7. Possibly might add danger notes
8. Learn how to use modchart.lua's
