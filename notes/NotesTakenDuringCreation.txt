**IMPORTANT**

INSTEAD OF USING THIS CHARACTER MENU, I HAVE ENDED UP MAKING ONE THAT WORKS IN BOTH FREEPLAY AND STORY MODE, I RECOMMEND READING THE OTHER NOTES AND TRYING TO DO THAT ONE,
BUT YOU CAN STILL USE THIS ONE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE OTHER ONE.

For anyone using the Character Menu, please read this.

I have been notified through a YouTube comment that compiling the CharMenu.hx alone wont work, and thats because I forgot to mention where I had put some variables.
So, I will quickly list were those variables are and should go.
Firstly, the sprTracker variable:

*Boyfriend.hx* - 
Put "public var sprTracker:FlxSprite;" inside of "class Boyfriend extends Character" underneath the "public var stunned:Bool = false;" but above the new funtion.
Then, after the super.update at the bottom, add this entire set of code:
 if (sprTracker != null)
		{
			x = (sprTracker.y * 2) + 90 - 350;
			y = FlxG.height / 3 - 68;
		}

*FreeplayState.hx* - 
Search for var icon:HealthIcon and right underneath it put "icon.sprTracker = songText;"

*HealthIcon.hx* - 
Right above the new function add the variable "public var sprTracker:FlxSprite;"
Then, at the bottom, underneath super.update add this if statment:
if (sprTracker != null)
			setPosition(sprTracker.x + sprTracker.width + 10, sprTracker.y - 30);

That should be all for the "sprTracker" variable, now for the "hasPlayedOnce" variable.

*PlayState.hx* - 
All you have to do is add "public static var hasPlayedOnce:Bool = false;" below "public static var noteBools:Array<Bool> = [false, false, false, false];"

For anyone doing Psych (from my own research), if you get these errors:
source/CharMenu.hx:148: characters 13-28 : Controls has no field LEFT_P
source/CharMenu.hx:149: characters 15-31 : Controls has no field RIGHT_P
Then, all you need to do is change LEFT_P and RIGHT_P to UI_LEFT_P and UI_RIGHT_P.
Although, these are untested, it should work based on the controls in the Psych Engine source code 
//If anyone tests this for Psych, please let me know if it works or not

This da Bob and Bossip code.... so.... credit for them. I just put here to have it on deck.
It for two NOTE_assets, one for player and one for enemy.
Put in PlayState.hx and edit lines 1736 - 1768. Good Luck future me!

Worked for me Past Me, thanks, but now the lines are wrong lol


public var color1:FlxColor = FlxColor.RED;
public var color2:FlxColor = FlxColor.LIME;

This is for healthbar (put into PlayState.hx) - I did already
^ I use those variables in the SONG.player1 and SONG.player2 cases.

healthBar.createFilledBar(color1, color2);

Might use color1 and color2 variables for song position color (possibly just color2)
What I don't understand is that I made color1 for player2 and color2 for player1, may switch later.
I also need to test if 'color1 = 0xFFFFFF' work with the FlxColor tag thingy. 
I know that 'color1 = FlxColor.CYAN' works, I just wanna know if the Hex code format works.
 Imma test now actually, idk why i putting this down as notes.

Wait, it wants to use 8 digit Hex, not 6, maybe if I add FF in front to make full not transparent?

Welp, when compiling, got no error so far, now waiting to load so i can check if color of healthBar changed and songPos.
Using Trey colors for example so, here his color 0xFF00FFE5. 

It half worked, it changed the healthBar color, but not songPos. Imma see if I can fix that

I did end up fixing that lol


Need to create other characters, may end up replacing Torch with one of my new characters, his nickname is Pyre.
I may also have to re-remaster Trey.
I will definitely have to create new arrows tho

Decided to not add Pyre, but may redo Torch and redo the arrows to better match the characters.
I am however going to be working on two other characters for my friends, one of which is for Merricide, the second one is going to be a surprise for now.
One thing I did actually do though was organize the characters in the selection list.
This was so it was easier for me to test them in the charting menu.
I mainly grouped the people together like all bf's, all gf's, the parents, yada yada


Firstly, I am working on making Torch and Trey's animations a little smoother as well as tryna figure out how imma do Merricide's character. 
Secondly, I managed to add the variable "SONG.player2" into the Note.hx. 
To do that, just import PlayState.SONG. I didn't think it was that easy lol.
Also, if you want something like the Bob and Bosip 'Split' notes, look for anything that says "SONG.player2 == 'trey'" and you'll find all the code you need.


I'm making a build of my mod for now, but just to let y'all know, the only things that are really changed are healthbar colors, and no not all are changed yet.
I did change the enemy in Dadbattle to Trey as a test, but I forgot to save the note style.
If you want to test out the new notes, make sure Trey is the enemy and the Note Type is "torchn'trey"
As a reminder, the note selection is in the 7 Debug Menu.
