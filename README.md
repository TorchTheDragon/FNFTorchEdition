Once I edit this mod more, I will add some shit to this readme file, but for now, imma just put what I want here


If you want to see what I have done, inside the Source folder I have a file called "NotesTakenDuringCreation.txt" that I have been updating while working on the mod. I know the notes may be a little hard to follow, but they also show what I am doing and where I currently am for progress in this mod.
