# IMPORTANT
I had seen the ["Vs. Ace"](https://github.com/ArcyDev/Vs-Ace "Vs. Ace Source Code") mod and had managed to get the source code for it, so, using it, I plan on figuring out how to use their character menu, which works in both Story Mode and Freeplay. This will also help me to learn how to create unlockable songs, and, if I choose to, unlockable selectable characters. I also decided to download the source code for the ["VS Sunday [Remastered]"](https://github.com/bbpanzu/FNF-Sunday "FNF Sunday Source Code") in order to learn how to do in song events, like in the final songs, and how to change notes mid song. Eventually, I hope to get Blantados' BETADCIU mod source code so I can figure out how to make it to where characters change mid song, mainly for when character get angry or something (if I decide to add these). I have also decided to download the ["Smoke 'Em Out Struggle: The Return Of Garcello"](https://github.com/TaeYai/Return-Of-Garcello "Return Of Garcello Source Code") so I can figure out how to stack more than 2 players in one song and how to swap controls between them. Overall, I plan on learning a lot and creating tutorials to show it all. I also hope that what I learn will help anyone who reads this. Overall, if you want me to try and learn something, and you know the mod it may be from, let me know and I will see if I can figure it out. 

# CHARACTER MENU
Alright so, I just want to say that I have managed to create a whole new character menu from the ["Vs. Ace"](https://github.com/ArcyDev/Vs-Ace "Vs. Ace Source Code") mod because it is just a lot better than the current one I have, and it works on both Freeplay and Story Mode. The only bug is that after you select a character and then you change weeks, the characters appears to have changed back to bf but in all reality your character is still chosen. 

# ADDITIONAL NOTES BELOW
Once I edit this mod more, I will add some shit to this readme file, but for now, imma just put what I want here


If you want to see what I have done, inside the Source folder I have a file called "NotesTakenDuringCreation.txt" that I have been updating while working on the mod. I know the notes may be a little hard to follow, but they also show what I am doing and where I currently am for progress in this mod.
