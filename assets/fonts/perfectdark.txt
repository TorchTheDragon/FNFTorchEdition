Thanks for Downloading Perfect Dark.


  This Font is based on the Logo from the game Perfect Dark.

  This Font uses Character Extenders [ !@#$%^ ] to give some of the
characters in the Font a longer TOP (when you have the letters A, a, D
and/or d in your text). For example, if you type out Perfect Dark",
type it out like this, Perfect D@a%rk" to give the a and r in Dark
extenders.  Each Extender is a different size:

! =x1 length
@ =x2 length
# =x3 length
$ =x4 length
% =x5 length
^ =x6 length

  The following characters do not use extenders: CcGgjOoQqSsXx0589"',.


  The whole Font is made with Capital letters but some of the
Characters have more than 1 letter Character.  They are:
Ee [the e has a slightly higher middle prong like in the PD LOGO]
Ff [the f has a slightly higher lower prong like in the PD LOGO]
Gg
Hh
Ii
Jj
Nn
Oo [you can also use 0 and ) for the O's or 0's]
Ss [you can also use 5 for an S and vice versa]
Uu
Vv
Xx


  A few last things.  This Font uses A LOT of Kerning to make the
Characters fit correctly so make sure what ever program you're using
have Character Kerning ON (sometimes if you're using a text editor
like Microsoft Word, you usualy have turn the Kerning ON).  Finally,
to make the Font look more like the Games Logo (slanted), use Italic
on the Font.

INSTALLING FONTS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  There's a couple of ways to install Fonts. The 'easy' way to
install fonts is to just Unzip/place the font file [.ttf] into your
Windows\Fonts directory (I always use this method). If you're unable
to do it the 'easy' way, then try to do it this way (for Windows
95/98/NT):

1] Unzip the Font(s) to a folder (or somewhere, just remember where
you unzipped it) on your Computer.

2] Next, click on the START button, then select SETTINGS then
CONTROL PANEL.

3] When the Control Panel Window pops up, Double Click on FONTS.

4] When the FONTS window pops up, select File then Install New Font...

5] A Add Fonts window will pop up, just go to the folder that you
unzipped the Font(s) to, select the Font(s) and then click on OK.
Now the Font(s) are installed.

  Now you can use the Font(s) in programs the utilize Fonts.  Make
sure that you install the font(s) first, then open up your apps
(so the app will recognize the font).    Sometimes you'll have to
wait until you computer 'auto-refreshes' for programs to recognize
fonts (Windows is sometimes slow to do that).  You can refresh your
computer quicker by going into Windows Explorer -or- My Computer and
press ALT + V, then R (or in the menubar select VIEW then REFRESH).
